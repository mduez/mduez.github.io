## Who we are and what we do  

Hello!  I’m pleased that you’re interested in the work going on in the
WSU numerical relativity (NR) group.  It’s a good idea for any student
to investigate many research fields and groups.  Numerical relativists
smash neutron stars and/or black holes into each other in computer
simulations to see what happens.  For many of us working in the field,
this is intrinsically fun enough to demand no further justification,
but NR simulations do have scientific value for two fields.  First,
they contribute to gravitational physics, the study of strongly curved
spacetimes.  Black holes and neutron stars are the best laboratories
for studying extreme gravity and testing general relativity that
nature has provided us.  Second, they contribute to multimessenger
astronomy, the study of violent phenomena in the universe that can be
observed using different types of signals, as opposed to just
different wavelengths of electromagnetic radiation.  The events we
model are detectable both electromagnetically and via gravitational
waves, and models are needed to make sense of the observations.  The
application to gravitational physics justifies our (fairly steady)
funding from NSF, and the application to multimessenger astronomy
justifies our (intermittent but very helpful) funding from NASA.  Most
of this money goes toward supporting graduate students; we’re grateful
to these agencies and to the taxpayers.

The NR group at WSU is led by me, Prof. Matt Duez.  It is part of the
“Simulating eXtreme Spacetimes” (SXS) collaboration, that includes
multiple academic institutions, most prominently Caltech and Cornell,
united by our common code.  There is also another relativity group at
WSU, led by Prof. Sukanta Bose and more directly connected to
LIGO-Virgo, which I also encourage you to check out.

Now for more detail on the physics we work with.
